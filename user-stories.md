#### MVP

- As an open minded movie viewer, I want to be able to input my snobby criteria for killer doll movies so I can be shown a suggestion that fits the bill.

- As a user, I want to be able to see my options for criteria clearly so I can make unambiguous decisions.

#### STRETCH GOALS

- As a discerning movie viewer, I want to be able to see information about my suggestions so I can see whether I want to see a different option.
- As a user, I'd like to be able to select that different option.

- As a user, I'd like to see a trailer for my suggestion(s) embedded into the page so I can watch it immediately.

- As a user, I'd like to leave some criteria blank/unselected and still be shown movie suggestions.
